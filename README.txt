Tarik Krestalica: Pong with Destruction

Description: The game is a simple pong program where the objective is that two players
hit a ball side by side. However, during the side by side action, each of the player's
paddles will be modified, and the ball's speed is continously modified through a series
of random animation speed throughout the program. This continues until either player 1
or player 2 score, in which the game resets back to normal. The game ends until either
player 1 or player 2 reaches 5 points.

Rules:
    1. Paddle Movement:
        Up, Down: Player 1
        W, S: Player 2
    2. When a paddle hits the ball, we remove one block at a time
    3. If the ball passes player 1 and player 2, the paddles will
       be refreshed to their original state
    4. First player to 5 points wins!
    5. Have fun!
